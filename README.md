# Drum-Kit
A web application where a user can use the mouse or keyboard buttons to play different sounds of the drums. Each drum has a different sound, and the user also gets an indication of which drum gets played. Used JavaScript event handlers, animations and audio files for the drum sound. Also used HTML5 and CSS3.
